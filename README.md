# Museum-Website-HTML-CSS-PHP-MySQL-
Stools &amp; Jewels Museum website ‚Äî a full-stack project combining HTML, CSS, and PHP to showcase exhibits, events, and visitor interaction through dynamic forms and database integration

##  What I Did in This Project

1. **Frontend (HTML + CSS)**

   * **index.html**: The homepage with a hero section and featured exhibits.
   * **about.html**: ‚ÄúAbout Us‚Äù page describing the mission and history of the museum.
   * **exhibits.html**: Displays featured items (diamond, antique stool) with images.
   * **events.html**: Lists upcoming events (e.g., Annual Diamond Exhibition, Furniture Display).
   * **contact.html**: Provides a contact form and an account creation form for visitors.
   * **styles1.css**: Centralized styling for layout, navigation bar, hero background, featured exhibits, and responsive design.

2. **Backend (PHP)**

   * **db\_connect.php**: Handles database connection (to support accounts and contact form submissions).
   * **test\_connection.php**: Tests database connectivity.
   * Forms in `contact.html` connect to PHP scripts (`create_account.php`, `contact_form.php`) for account creation and messaging.

3. **Design Choices**

   * Consistent **header & footer** across all pages with navigation.
   * Clean, modern **CSS design**: hero background image, styled buttons, exhibit cards.
   * Use of semantic HTML sections (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
